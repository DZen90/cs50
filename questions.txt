3.  BYTE - 1, DWORD - 4, LONG - 4, WORD - 2.
4.  0x4D42 or "BM"
5.  bfSize is the size of the bitmap file, biSize is the size of the structure BITMAPINFOHEADER
6.  If biHeight is negative the file is a top-down bitmap with its origin in the upper-left corner
7.  biBitCount specifies color depth
8.  fopen may return null if file cannot be opened: user doesn't have a permission to create files or not enough space
9.  The third argument is a number of elements to read. We read RGB triple structs one by one.
