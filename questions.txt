1.  Gets resource usage
2.  16
3.  So we don't have to copy their content
4.  After opening the text the first character of the text is assigned to c. 
In each iteration of the loop the next character from the text is assigned to c, until end of file is reached. 
C is checked, if it is an alphabetical character. If it is then it is added to the array word[].
If it isn't then is is either the end of the word (then check the word) or a digit (then skip the rest of the word).
If the word is too long, then it is skipped.
5.  If the word is too long, or if it contains digits, or there are no whitespace characters at all - 
fscanf will still read the whole word, and we will have to check it all for inappropriate characters, 
while fgetc allows us to check the characters before adding it to the word.
6.  So we cannot change the value of the parameters inside the functions.
